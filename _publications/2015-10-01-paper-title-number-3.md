**Abstract:**

_Ormia ochracea_ is an acoustic parasitoid fly where the adults are free-living, but their larval young depend on nutritional resources within host crickets for growth and development. In nature, gravid female flies rely on their ability to recognize and localize cricket calling songs to find suitable host species to parasitize. Previous work has demonstrated that flies can parasitize a number of natural host cricket species, and their larvae can also develop in some cricket species that are not their natural hosts. However, we lack a complete understanding of fly developmental outcomes in relation to resource competition and host size. We address these knowledge gaps by using Acheta domesticus as a host species, and specifically test the hypothesis that host size and resource competition can affect developmental outcomes of O. ochracea. We performed manual parasitizations on crickets that varied in size, and resource competition was varied by manipulating the number of larvae used to parasitize a host cricket. In the absence of resource competition, we found that host cricket size did not affect pupation or eclosion success. In the presence of resource competition between two developing larvae within a host cricket, pupation and eclosion successes were impacted negatively, and the developing pupae were more likely to be smaller. These results confirm that resource competition among developing parasitoids can negatively affect the developmental outcomes in a laboratory setting. This provides additional insights into how resource competition may impact the development of parasitoids in their natural hosts in nature.
