======



I was born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam. After finishing high school, I moved to Northfield, Minnesota to attend St. Olaf College. It was here that I discovered the fascinating intersection of mathematics and neuroscience through classes beyond the general curriculum. During my my time at St. Olaf College, I serve as the collegiate football team manager and many teaching assistant positions.

In May 2025, I graduted from St. Olaf and now I am a graduate student at University of Nevada, Reno under Floris Van Breugel Lab studying the olafactory navigation in _Drosophilla_.
