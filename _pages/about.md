======



I was born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam. After finishing high school, I moved to Northfield, Minnesota to attend St. Olaf College. It was here that I discovered the fascinating intersection of mathematics and neuroscience through classes beyond the general curriculum.

I am a graduate student at University of Nevada, Reno under Floris Van Breugel Lab studying the olafactory navigation in _Drosophilla_

At St. Olaf, I serve as the collegiate football team manager. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, playing badminton, and listening to podcasts. Being a St. Olaf student has given me opportunities to travel, experience new cultures, and build meaningful relationships around the world.
